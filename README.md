<p>This is a small resource management type game I made for fun during the summer of 2023. The game is centered around the mining mechanic in which you press the button on the left side of the screen to collect the given material. If the material requires a tool that you are missing, the button will be red and you will not collect the material. The goal is to collect resources and craft better tools to increase efficiency. The strongest tools in the game are bronze.</p>
<p>The game uses mostly JavaScript with JQuery and Bootstrap to help with UI elements </p>
